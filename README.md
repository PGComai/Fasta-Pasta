# Fasta Pasta

This is a graphical tool for analyzing short repeats in DNA sequences.

## Features

- View single or multiple sections of FASTA file
- Pick any 100-length section and get near-instant match results from 0% to 100%
- Manually enter any 100-length sequence

## Current Issues/Limitations

- "Load" button will load the file even if it is already loaded, and loaded files cannot be cleared except by restarting the program
- User interface is not optimized for high resolution displays
- Only supports short repeats of length 100 bases
- Cannot analyze sequences larger than 152,087,500 bases
- Viewing multiple sequences at once requires lots of vertical screen space
- Uses lots of memory

## Future Plans

- Support for analyzing arbitrarily long sequences
- Selectable short repeat length options (1000, 100, 50, 25)
- Export analysis results
- Accessibility features such as displaying the results as audio
